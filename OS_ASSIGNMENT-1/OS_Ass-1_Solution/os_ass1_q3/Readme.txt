This program takes input from the file named "input.txt" and works as a 
calculator for given numbers a and b for the provided operations, which are 
"xor", "product" and "compare".

After reading the input.txt file, using if-else statements, the program does
the operations. If the operation is xor, the program prints the result a^b in 
the output.txt file in the result folder. Else if the operation in the text 
is a product the program does the a*b operation and similarly for the 
operation compare.

In the end, by using yet another else statement, if the operation given in 
the input.txt file is not either of the three operations, it prints "Invalid 
operation".

The program runs until it reads all of the input file.
