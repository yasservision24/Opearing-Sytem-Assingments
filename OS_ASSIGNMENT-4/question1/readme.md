Explanation
1. Resource Acquisition:
Each philosopher goes through a cycle of thinking, attempting to acquire forks, and then attempting to acquire a bowl.
Philosophers use the pthread_mutex_lock function to acquire locks on their left and right forks.
A while loop is used with pthread_mutex_trylock and pthread_cond_wait to wait for a bowl to become available.

2. Eating and Releasing Resources:
Once a philosopher successfully acquires both forks and a bowl, they enter the eating phase.
The eating function simulates the philosopher eating.
After eating, the philosopher releases the acquired forks and the bowl using pthread_mutex_unlock.

3. Signaling the Next Philosopher:
The pthread_cond_signal function is used to signal the next philosopher to check for resource availability.
This helps in ensuring a fair distribution of resources among philosophers.
Deadlock Avoidance:
The code implements a deadlock-free solution by ensuring that each philosopher waits for the availability of both forks and a bowl before proceeding to eat. The use of pthread_mutex_trylock in the while loop for bowl acquisition prevents philosophers from blocking indefinitely. If a philosopher cannot acquire the bowl, they release the fork locks and wait for the signal to retry. This mechanism breaks potential circular waiting scenarios and prevents deadlocks.

Fairness:
Fairness is introduced through the use of Conditional Variables (can_eat) associated with each philosopher. Here's how fairness is achieved:

Philosophers wait for the availability of both forks and a bowl using pthread_cond_wait.
When a philosopher finishes eating, they signal the next philosopher to check for resource availability using pthread_cond_signal.
This signaling allows waiting philosophers to proceed with attempting to acquire resources.
The signaling mechanism ensures that philosophers take turns in acquiring resources, preventing one philosopher from dominating resource access. However, the degree of fairness can still depend on the system scheduler and other factors.

In summary, the provided solution combines Mutexes, Conditional Variables, and signaling to avoid deadlocks and introduce fairness in the Dining Philosophers problem with bowls. Each philosopher follows a set of rules to acquire and release resources, and the signaling mechanism ensures that all philosophers get a fair chance to eat.



Avoiding Deadlocks:

The philosophers pick up the forks and bowls in a specific order (left fork, right fork, bowl).
If a philosopher can't pick up both forks and the bowl, it releases the acquired forks and bowl, preventing deadlocks.
Using a signaling mechanism (pthread_cond_signal) ensures that the next philosopher can start eating only when the current philosopher has finished eating.
Fairness:

The use of conditional variables ensures fairness by allowing only the next philosopher to eat after the current philosopher has finished.
The randomness in thinking and eating times introduces variability in the order in which philosophers pick up resources, making the solution fairer.
Deadlock Explanation:

Deadlocks can occur when each philosopher picks up one fork and waits indefinitely for the adjacent fork. If all philosophers simultaneously pick up their left fork, a circular waiting scenario arises, leading to a deadlock.
Avoidance Strategy:

The philosophers follow a disciplined order to pick up resources: left fork, right fork, and then the bowl.
If a philosopher can't pick up all resources, it releases the acquired ones and tries again later.
Using conditional variables ensures that philosophers signal the next philosopher to eat only after they have finished eating, preventing circular waiting.
Fairness:

The signaling mechanism ensures that philosophers take turns to eat.
The use of random thinking and eating times adds variability to the order in which philosophers access resources, making the solution fairer.
Estimation of Fairness:

Due to the randomness in thinking and eating times, each philosopher has a roughly equal chance to access resources.
The fairness also depends on the system scheduler, and some philosophers may wait longer during contention for resources.
Note: This implementation may not be perfectly fair in all scenarios and might still suffer from starvation or other scheduling issues depending on the system environment. Fine-tuning fairness in concurrent programs often involves more complex synchronization mechanisms*/
