Overall Logic:
Shared Variables:

The program uses shared variables like counter to keep track of the number of passengers on the car.
totalSeats represents the total number of available seats in the car.
counter1 is used in the offboarding process to keep track of the remaining passengers.
Semaphores:

semaphore: Used to control access to the critical section where the counter variable is modified.
offboardSemaphore: Controls access during the offboarding process.
boardSemaphore: Controls access before the boarding process.
Mutexes:

Several mutexes (loadMutex, rideMutex, unloadMutex, and counterMutex) are used to ensure exclusive access to shared resources and prevent data races.
Conditions:

Conditions (loadCond, rideCond, and unloadCond) are employed to synchronize threads at specific points in the program's execution.
Functions:
load():

Simulates the loading process, introducing a delay of 1 second.
Broadcasts the loadCond condition, signaling that loading is complete.
board():

Uses a semaphore (semaphore) to control access to the critical section where the counter variable is modified.
Checks if there are available seats, increments the counter, and signals the car thread when all seats are occupied.
ride():

Waits for the ride condition to be signaled by the car thread.
Simulates the ride process with a 2-second delay.
unload():

Simulates the unloading process, introducing a delay of 1 second.
Broadcasts the unloadCond condition, signaling that unloading is complete.
offboard():

Uses a semaphore (offboardSemaphore) to control access during the offboarding process.
Decreases the counter1 until zero, simulating passengers offboarding.
carThread():

Represents the car thread that performs loading, riding, and unloading.
passengerThread():

Represents passenger threads that wait for loading to complete, board, wait for the ride to finish, and then offboard.
Concurrency Bug Avoidance:
Semaphore and Mutex Usage:

Semaphores are used to control access to critical sections, ensuring that only one thread at a time can modify shared variables like counter.
Mutexes are employed to protect critical sections and prevent data races.
Conditions:

Conditions are used to synchronize threads at specific points, preventing them from proceeding until certain conditions are met.
Mutex for Counter:

The counterMutex ensures that modifications to the shared counter variable are atomic and mutually exclusive.
Semaphores for Boarding and Offboarding:

Semaphores are used to control access during the boarding and offboarding processes, avoiding race conditions.
Dynamic Memory Allocation:

Memory is dynamically allocated for an array of passenger threads to accommodate a variable number of passengers.
Error Handling:

The code includes error handling for semaphore initialization, thread creation, and thread joining, ensuring robustness.
In summary, the code employs semaphores, mutexes, conditions, and dynamic memory allocation to avoid concurrency bugs and ensure the correct synchronization of threads in the amusement park ride simulation. The careful use of synchronization primitives helps prevent race conditions and ensures the proper execution of the ride simulation.
